# Make Automations Portfolio

This repository contains a collection of real-world Make.com (Integromat) automations I've built to improve productivity, streamline workflows, and support IT operations in warehouse and office environments.

These scenarios demonstrate my practical use of automation tools to solve problems without code, often integrating platforms such as Google Sheets, Forms, Maps, and more.
